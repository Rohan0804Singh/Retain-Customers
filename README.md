## The data set includes information about:
1) Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn.
2) Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online
security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.
3)  Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment
method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

dependents
